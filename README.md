Seeing comes before words. It is seeing which establishes our place in the surrounding world; we explain that world with words. Paintings are often reproduced with words around them. It is hard to define exactly how the words [change] the image but undoubtedly they [do]. The image illustrates the sentence. - Ways of Seeing, John Berger

## No Context
No Context is an experimental site. It invites users to enter a search to find an image from a connected Reddit post. Provided an image, users are asked to write a short blurb about the image. Thereafter, sentiment analysis is performed on the user'sÂ input, and the post's top comments. A link to the image's post is provided for users to understand the intended story behind the image.
