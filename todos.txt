    - check: messages, types, error handling
    - [mobile] fix scroll cutoff + behavior
    - use sentiment connotation (+/-/0) to trigger brief raining (🙂/☹️/😐) emoji effect?

states:
1. waiting for reddit input: "What topic shall we search?"
    at submit => {
        do reddit api call
        if post is valid {
            display post.image and go to state 2
        } else {
            ask for reddit input: "sorry, there was no post matching that topic"
        }
    }

2. waiting for story input
    at submit => {
        do google api calls with story and comments from post
        if error {
            sorry, something went wrong
        } else {
            display/render sentiment
            change to state 1
        }
    }



Possible Errors:
- error at reddit API call - OK
- no query result
- no query result with image
- error at google API call
- invalid input, like a submit on an empty input?
