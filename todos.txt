1. waiting for reddit input: "What topic shall we search?"
    at submit => {
        do reddit api call
        if post is valid {
            display post.image and go to state 2
        } else {
            ask for reddit input: "sorry, there was no post matching that topic"
        }
    }

2. waiting for story input
    at submit => {
        do google api calls with story and comments from post
        if error {
            sorry, something went wrong
        } else {
            display/render sentiment
            change to state 1
        }
