    - flesh out the messages and error handling
    - check deployment env variables
    - add types and error handling

1. waiting for reddit input: "What topic shall we search?"
    at submit => {
        do reddit api call

        } else {
            ask for reddit input: "sorry, there was no post matching that topic"
        }
    }

2. waiting for story input
    at submit => {

            sorry, something went wrong
        } else {
            display/render sentiment
