Seeing comes before words ... Paintings are often reproduced with words around them. It is hard to define exactly how the words [change] the image but undoubtedly they [do]. The image illustrates the sentence. - Ways of Seeing, John Berger

## No Context
This site invites users to enter a search to find an image from a connected Reddit post. Once an image is found, users are prompted to write a short blurb about the image, and sentiment analysis is performed on the user'sÂ input, and the post's top comments. Thereafter, a link to the image's post is provided for users to understand the story behind the image.
